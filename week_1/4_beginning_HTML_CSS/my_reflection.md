## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

-       HTML is pretty straight forward from what I’ve seen so far. I enjoy working in it for that reason, what you put down is what you get. I haven’t come across anything that doesn’t make sense yet. Working in sublime makes it super easy by helping you with closing marks and inputting syntax you might forget.

-       HTML is good since it’s hard to really mess up what you’re doing. It’s also great to be able to see it live in a browser as you work (just by saving and refreshing) and fix anything you don’t like. It’s bad since there not much style to it. HTML is like typing a word doc to the internet.

-       My “aha” moment was with the <title> tab. I was trying to add font to the input with CSS and didn’t understand why it wasn’t working, or where the title body went! Then I looked up in the tab on the browser and realized what <title> does.

-       I found this resource that helped me create a img as a link. Girldevelopit didn’t really explain it too well.
