## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://robschwartz.github.io/

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

This project showed how much goes into the smallest site. I can already see myself progressing by using past objectives to push me through new ones. I enjoyed the process of doing this on my own but some things I still am not sure I understand. For instance, I had a bit of trouble uploading the file to my live github page. I eventually made it work but went through a couple of errors and nervous sweats before it worked. I am still not completly sure how I did it. I am getting comfortable with html but CSS styling is still a little confusing. I could use a more in depth class on margins, boarders, and sidebars.
