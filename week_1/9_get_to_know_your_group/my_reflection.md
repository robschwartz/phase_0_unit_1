Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

The readings make me feel much more at ease. With so many applicants, you wonder where you will fall in the rankings and experience level. It seems like everyone is on the same page and is very open to helping one another. Itâ€™s nice to see this is not a dog-eat-dog environment, but a community where everyone helps each other survive.
