## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

- I did not have any struggle really. The screen shots and instructions were very straight forward.
- Git is a device that lives on your computer where you can work on multiple versions of the same project. It allows you to add, remove, replace, etc to your project while always saving the older version in case you aren't happy with your change and forget what you did. Github is a public version of git where anyone can see your project and they have the option to add, delete, and change the code while the older version is automatically saved. 
- Version control is an awesome way to track every change made to a file. Github helps us keep track of the changes by showing us what changed, when the change was made, and who made the change. This is great since if someone makes a change you don't understand or want to delete, Github gives you that option to reach out them and understand why they made the change.
- Developers use git to keep track of any and all changes that they make while working on a project. This makes complete sense and I wish they had this for everyday life. If I am cooking a dish and by accident put too much salt, I would love to go back to that moment right before and do things differently. Or I made a dish and can’t remember how or what I did, I can look back and see exactly how much of what I included. Git allows me to do this with my code which is awesome
- As of right now, things are pretty basic and easy to understand. I’m sure I will update this in the future with concepts that go over my head.
