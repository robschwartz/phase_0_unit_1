- To create a repository on Github, first log in to your account and click on the "+" button to create something new, from the drop down, choose "New Repository". At the top of the page you should see your username in the "Owner" box. If your name is not there, change it so you are the owner. Next to that box you create your repository name. You can have this be anything you like. For this instance, you should put "[USERNAME].github.io". Make sure the box "Public" is marked so others can see and edit the file. Also click the "Initialize... README" button to add a README file to your repo. Once finished click the "Create Repository" and you're all set!
- Next, go to your Github App and clone it to your computer. You do this by finding your username under "Github.com" and clicking on your name. From there, just click on the "Clone to your computer" button to clone it! Then you're all set!
