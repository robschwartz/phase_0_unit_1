-          For this challenge I had a difficult time using the materials offered to teach us the topics and implementing them into practice. I found myself not understanding how to write a caption on an image, how to reshape an image, how to create a footer, and span was a little confusing. I’m still not sure if I have span right.

-          Here are the resources I used to help guide me through the project.

-          I could still use help on span. I would like to learn more about how to change the aesthetics of my page. For example- make my font a bit nicer, have my boxes have curved edges, etc.

-          I learnt a bit about font styling in CSS. My thought process right now is to spec out a site and get all the content up first, then from there start adding the CSS and design to the page.

-          My confidence level is a 7/10 right now. I need to work a bit more and practice creating pages with a bit more material in order to see how everything looks while it is full.  Some material I did have trouble with, captions mainly. I also am not sure I have fully figured out span and wrapping.

-          I enjoyed creating a site and learning the basics of front end development. I am excited to look back at this first project and see where I have come from to where I have gone. I think of this as drawing with crayons, simple and entry level. Soon I will be painting with oil.

-          The most tedious part was creating content and moving it around the page. We don’t realize how small pixels are and how many there are to each page. Moving my caption to where I wanted it took about 10 tries. I will do some research on automatic positioning and text placement.
