* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
1. Website and a Web App are very different. Website is a site which doesn't require much maintinence where as a webapp requires constant attention
2. When you update your IP address, is as if you are changing your number and might take time for people to reach your site. 

* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
First of all, save it as a .html file. That is how you create the HTML site. Second, remmeber that html isn't going to make your site very fancy, its the base for CSS. 

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live
I hit a couple snags while getting it up to be live so once I saw it do exactly what I wanted, I got goosebumps. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
My "aha" moment came when I read that the internet and the world wide web are 2 different things. I always knew this but didn't ever say it out loud, if that makes sense.
