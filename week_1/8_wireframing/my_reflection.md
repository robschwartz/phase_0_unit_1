## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

The overall design process was new to me. I understand why it is necessary but never really understood how technical the process is. Sometimes I think that the process is OVER complicated and too thought-out.  Does every little detail really matter? I believe content is king. One of the sites I reviewed- DansDeals- is a very simple site but he has TONS of followers since he puts up content people are interested in. I don’t think there’s a site I navigate to strictly for the design. Yes the design might keep me active by placing things in certain places, but if I don’t like the material, I usually navigate away.

To create the wireframes for the sites I reviewed I reached out the community and they offered up a great resource. The site is called http://www.wirify.com/. Super easy to use. The main questions I’ll have converting design to code is placing the content in the specified location. I have to practice spacing and floating. The process wasn’t tedious or frustrating, more just learning. I would like to have a more in depth training on design since it is useful to know. It’s pairs well with development and they are both needed for a successful site.
