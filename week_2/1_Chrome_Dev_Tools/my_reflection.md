# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is how we interact with the Web today. It allows us to create different functions and “events” to make the page less static and more interactive. I like how they break everything down into a family tree. This really puts it into perspective on how a change on one element will affect another element. I am still not sure how to incorporate JavaScript into the HTML pages since I haven’t looked at it too much yet. Just from the readings and the Code Class, it seems like this is a much easier way of editing web pages. The changes are live and immediate whereas when you are working with a file on your console, you need to save and refresh the page to see how it looks live.

The main difference I saw was there are many more elements on the Wordpress site than mine. It looks like there is some cross browser scripting as well as JavaScript. I think if I spent a full day on my site, I would be able to update it to have more flare and design than it has now.

I enjoy working with the CWT. It’s nice to see the live changes and be able to click on an element and be brought directly to the code line. I also like the way you can click on and off CSS styles as you wish.
