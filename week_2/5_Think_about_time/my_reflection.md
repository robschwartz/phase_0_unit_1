# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?<br>
My biggest challenge during Phase 0 is balancing my work, life, family, and friends on top of the Phase 0 material. I would love to do phase 0 work all day but I have a full time job that eats up 50+ hours a week including commute. After work, I have an hour before my wife comes home and I have to start my husbandly duties. This is when I can really get good work done. I have the place to myself and I can work in peace. My wife has been great about letting me work when I need to but we ALREADY don’t spend a lot of time together during so it would be nice to have everything finished by the time she gets home. I also cook and clean dinner so that eats up time as well.<br>

·         How will you combat that?<br>
I have been finding down time that I use to do the reading and reflections in order to be able to just code when I am at home in front of my machine. I take the bus to and from work so I email the articles to myself and read what I can. I used to use this time to check Facebook, Instagram and play Candy Crush (I have a problem with this, intervention needed) but now I use it to expand my mind by reading the material.<br>
When work isn’t too busy or during lunch, I find time to write my blog content or reflections (which I am doing right now). I will write out all the content then email it to myself so I can commit the work from my machine at home. Again, I try to leave as much time as possible for hands on coding when I am at home.<br><br>
·         What techniques will you try?<br>
I will try the mediation technique for sure. I have already downloaded the Headspace app. I love taking walks just to walk so this will give me something to do on those walks. The articles were great to read on how meditation can not only effect your mindfulness but your everyday life. If only everyone else mediated so they would be I the same place you are. Some people get upset when you are so calm in a frustrating situation. I hope the vibe I am giving off can be contagious.<br>
I also plan on taking 1 day off a week to decompose and not look at any of the material or challenges. I think this is important to do so you can remind yourself you are a real person with a life. The workload is a lot but if you manage your time well, you can still have some free time.<br><br>
·         What is your overall plan for Phase 0?<br>
Weekday Schedule:<br>
6:30- Wake up<br>
7:00- Open the comp and check out the challenge for the day. Send myself articles to read on bus on way to work/ eat breakfast<br>
7:45-8:15- leave to work/ read on bus<br>
 8:30- 5:00- Work/ find time to complete challenges/ write reflections/ blog posts/ work<br>
5:15- read more articles on bus<br>
6:00-7:00- jump into code or set up pairing session.<br>
7:00-10:00- Be a husband/ eat dinner/ decompose/ work a bit on coding
10:00- 11:00- In bed, watch a show or do more research.<br><br>
This plan has been working so far for the past 2 weeks. As long as I can finish all the writing and reflection challenges by Thursday I see myself on pace. Then I have 2 days (taking 1 day off) to get down and dirty with code. Also leaves me some time to be a human and go out with friends.
