# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://robschwartz.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? <br>
-I learnt the design process is never finished. It is a living anf breating entity. I am not a designer so designing and wireframing the site is going to be a challenge. 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)<br>
-It was fun doing the design and UX part of the website. I must have entered over 50 differnt colors before finding one that I liked. I ended up using the mindset of K.I.S.S- Keep it simple stupid. 
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?<br>
-My process was to take the wirefram I laid out and look at it as a bunch of small projects instead of one big project. This worked well since I didn't overwhelme myself with the big picture. 
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?<br>
- I would work on the responsiveness of the site. It is a bit responsive right now but no where near what I need it to be.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?<br>
-Responsive design was the hardest to apply. The one trick that I really liked was being able to jump down to a section in our own website. I have seen it done before but have never done it. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
- Will update...
