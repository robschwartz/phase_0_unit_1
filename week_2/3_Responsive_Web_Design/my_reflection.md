# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not? <br>
Responsive Web Design (RWD) is the ability to create a web page that will resize its design and contents based on the size of the screen it is loaded on. This is the new norm for web development. It’s ideal for today’s tech world since every different device has its unique size. IPhones, IPad, MacBook, Android, even Smart TVs all need a specific design to make sure the ascetics of your site come off as intended. This way of development is great on smaller devices since it allows me to interact with the site as intended without needing to zoom out the entire site.  <br>

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?<br>
Software conforms to hardware. We wanted options and we got them. Then we had to make sure that we were able to use these new gadgets as intended. This is where HTML5 came in to play. It was created specifically for flexibility. I’m sure this won’t be the last version of HTML and as we grow or shrink our screen sizes and screen flexibility, we will need to update our software.<br>

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?<br>
Visually impaired people use the internet by having it speak to them. There is a great article (http://gizmodo.com/5620079/giz-explains-how-blind-people-see-the-internet/all) on how they interact with different pages and find what they are looking for. They use the text content much more than any other user since this is all they interact with. In terms of design, they can care less about images and more about design our content to be readable and organized. Since they are a small percentage of your user base, it’s not IDEAL to create the web page for them, but it’s nice to be mindful of it.<br>

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?<br>
The idea of wire framing is one that makes a lot of sense to me. It is creating an outline or a picture of your site before starting to work on it. Design is always changing but it is smart to have a template or blueprint of what you are going to be creating. It’s also smart since you can split up your one really large project to many small projects. It’s the same idea of when you are doing pushups, if you plan on doing 20 in a row, break it down to 10-7-3. It’s mentally much easier.<br>
I haven’t figured out the @font element yet. I used it quickly in the last challenge but need to work with it more hands on. I have a very action oriented learning style.<br>
