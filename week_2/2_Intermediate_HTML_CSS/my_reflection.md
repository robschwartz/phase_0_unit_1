# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad? <br>
- Web Standards are put in place to set a template for web pages. This is a great way to make sure web pages are viewed the same on any web browser. That being said, it doesn’t offer too much design which is why other languages and functions were created. I like to think of Web Standards as having a blank canvas where you only have certain tools you can use to paint a picture. Also, your painting is in compliance with the “Artists Association” rules. 

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not? <br>
- It makes sense since if we didn’t have the structure, every browser would try have their own set of rules. This would cause chaos when trying to pull up the same site on different browsers since if a site is built for only one browser, it might not fit the same standards for the others. This would also make the programmers job twice or three times as hard! 

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?<br>
-The new elements in HTML5 are awesome! It’s much cleaner than throwing <div> before every element. It’s great to get rid of those div-its. 

* Why is reset.css necessary? <br>
-HTML and CSS come with a standardized layout for certain items and elements. For instance: font is 12px, unordered lists are bulleted, paragraphs have default padding, and so on. Resetting the CSS give you more control on your elements and REALLY let you start from scratch.   

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?<br>
-I use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and (I know, WHY????) Internet Explorer. I work in recruiting of digital freelancers so I see a ton of design portfolios. Multiple times the site does not look the same on IE as it does on Chrome or Firefox. I definitely think it’s bad that this happens. I base my decision to call a candidate for an open job based on their portfolio. If I didn’t know that IE shows a worse version of their designs, I would think they weren’t as talented as they are. I always use chrome now.
